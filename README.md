# TaskManagementApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.1.

#  Scenario:
You are tasked with building a task management application in Angular. The application should allow users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and filter tasks based on their completion status. Your task is to implement the necessary components and functionality to achieve these requirements.

#  Assessment Tasks:
Create an Angular project and generate the necessary components for the task management application.
Implement the components needed to display a list of tasks.
The task list should display the title of each task and provide a way to mark tasks as completed.
Include a button or mechanism to filter tasks based on their completion status (e.g., All, Completed, Incomplete).
Implement the functionality to add new tasks to the task list.
Provide a user interface (e.g., form, input field) to enter task details.
When a new task is added, it should appear in the task list.
Implement the functionality to mark tasks as completed.
Provide a mechanism (e.g., checkbox, button) to mark a task as completed.
When a task is marked as completed, its appearance should reflect its completion status in the task list.
Implement the filtering functionality to display tasks based on their completion status.
When a filter option is selected (e.g., Completed), only tasks matching the selected status should be displayed.
Test your implementation by adding tasks, marking them as completed, and verifying that the filtering functionality works as expected.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
